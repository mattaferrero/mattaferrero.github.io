## About Me

Hello world! I'm currently studying Information Technology at Broward College with a focus in Software and Systems Development, with a future goal of transitioning to Aerospace Engineering. In my spare time I absolutely love working on my electronics and programming projects, most of which I cover here on this website! Right now the largest project which is taking up most of my time is a simple bootloader and kernel for a 32-bit x86 system (current codename MAA-OS).
